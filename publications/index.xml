Abstract
In functional data analysis, functional linear regression has attracted significant attention recently. Herein, we consider the case where both the response and covariates are functions. There are two available approaches for addressing such a situation: concurrent and nonconcurrent functional models. In the former, the value of the functional response at a given domain point depends only on the value of the functional regressors evaluated at the same domain point, whereas, in the latter, the functional covariates evaluated at each point of their domain have a non-null effect on the response at any point of its domain.</description>

Abstract
A chemometric data analysis challenge has been arranged during the first edition of the &amp;ldquo;International Workshop on Spectroscopy and Chemometrics&amp;rdquo;, organized by the Vistamilk SFI Research Centre and held online in April 2021. The aim of the competition was to build a calibration model in order to predict milk quality traits exploiting the information contained in mid-infrared spectra only. Three different traits have been provided, presenting heterogeneous degrees of prediction complexity thus possibly requiring trait-specific modelling choices.</description>

Abstract
When functional data are observed on parts of the domain, it is of interest to recover the missing parts of curves. Kraus (2015) proposed a linear reconstruction method based on ridge regularization. Kneip and Liebl (2019) argue that an assumption under which Kraus (2015) established the consistency of the ridge method is too restrictive and propose a principal component reconstruction method that they prove to be asymptotically optimal.</description>

Abstract
Bayesian nonparametric density estimation is dominated by single-scale methods, typically exploiting mixture model specifications, exception made for Pólya trees prior and allied approaches. In this paper we focus on developing a novel family of multiscale stick-breaking mixture models that inherits some of the advantages of both single-scale nonparametric mixtures and Pólya trees. Our proposal is based on a mixture specification exploiting an infinitely deep binary tree of random weights that grows according to a multiscale generalization of a large class of stick-breaking processes; this multiscale stick-breaking is paired with specific stochastic processes generating sequences of parameters that induce stochastically ordered kernel functions.</description>

Abstract
We study the dynamics of cause-specific mortality rates among countries by considering them as compositions of functions. We develop a novel framework for such data structure, with particular attention to functional PCA. The application of this method to a subset of the WHO ùmortality database reveals the main modes of variation of cause-specific rates over years for men and women and enables us to perform clustering in the projected subspace.</description>

Abstract
We consider classification of functional data into two groups by linear classifiers based on one-dimensional projections of functions. We reformulate the task of finding the best classifier as an optimization problem and solve it by the conjugate gradient method with early stopping, the principal component method, and the ridge method. We study the empirical version with finite training samples consisting of incomplete functions observed on different subsets of the domain and show that the optimal, possibly zero, misclassification probability can be achieved in the limit along a possibly nonconvergent empirical regularization path.</description>

Abstract
Functional data are usually assumed to be observed on a common domain. However, it is often the case that some portion of the functional data is missing for some statistical unit, invalidating most of the existing techniques for functional data analysis. The development of methods able to handle partially observed or incomplete functional data is currently attracting increasing interest. We here briefly review this literature. We then focus on discrimination based on principal component analysis and illustrate a few possible methods via simulation studies and an application to the AneuRisk65 data set.</description>
